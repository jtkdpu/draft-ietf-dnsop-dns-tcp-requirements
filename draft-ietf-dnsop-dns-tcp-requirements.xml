   <section title="Introduction">
     <t>DNS messages may be delivered using UDP or TCP communications.
     While most DNS transactions are carried over UDP, some operators
     have been led to believe that any DNS over TCP traffic is unwanted or
     unnecessary for general DNS operation.  As usage and features have
     evolved, TCP transport has become increasingly important for correct and
     safe operation of the Internet DNS.  Reflecting modern usage, the DNS
     standards were recently updated to declare support for TCP is now a
     required part of the DNS implementation specifications in
     <xref target="RFC7766"></xref>.  This document is the formal
     requirements equivalent for the operational community, encouraging
     operators to ensure DNS over TCP communications support is on par
     with DNS over UDP communications.</t>

     <section title="Requirements Language">
       <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
       "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
       document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
       target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>
     </section>

   </section>

   <section title="Background">

     <section title="Uneven Transport Usage and Preference">
       <t>In the original suite of DNS specifications, <xref
       target="RFC1034"></xref> and <xref target="RFC1035"></xref>
       clearly specified that DNS messages could be carried in either
       UDP or TCP, but they also made clear a preference for UDP as the
       transport for queries in the general case.  As stated in <xref
       target="RFC1035"></xref>:
       <list hangIndent="10" style="empty">
         <t>"While virtual circuits can be used for any DNS activity,
         datagrams are preferred for queries due to their lower overhead
         and better performance."</t>
       </list>
       </t>

       <t>Another early, important, and influential document,
       <xref target="RFC1123"></xref>, detailed the preference for UDP
       more explicitly:<list hangIndent="10" style="empty">
         <t>"DNS resolvers and recursive servers MUST support UDP, and
         SHOULD support TCP, for sending (non-zone-transfer) queries."
         </t>
       </list>
       and further stipulated:<list hangIndent="10" style="empty">
         <t>A name server MAY limit the resources it devotes to TCP
         queries, but it SHOULD NOT refuse to service a TCP query just
         because it would have succeeded with UDP.</t>
       </list>
       </t>

       <t>Culminating in <xref target="RFC1536"></xref>, DNS over TCP
       came to be associated primarily with the zone transfer mechanism,
       while most DNS queries and responses were seen as the dominion of
       UDP.</t>
     </section>

     <section title="Waiting for Large Messages and Reliability">
       <t>As stipulated in the original specifications, DNS messages
       over UDP were restricted to a 512-byte message size.  However,
       even while <xref target="RFC1123"></xref> made a clear preference
       for UDP, it foresaw DNS over TCP becoming more popular in the
       future:
       <list hangIndent="10" style="empty">
         <t>"[...] it is also clear that some new DNS record types
         defined in the future will contain information exceeding the
         512 byte limit that applies to UDP, and hence will require
         TCP.</t>
       </list>
       At least two new, widely anticipated developments were set to
       elevate the need for DNS over TCP transactions.  The first was
       dynamic updates defined in <xref target="RFC2136"></xref> and the
       second was the set of extensions collectively known as DNSSEC
       originally specified in <xref target="RFC2541"></xref>.  The
       former suggested "requestors who require an accurate response
       code must use TCP", while the later warned "[...] larger keys
       increase the size of KEY and SIG RRs.  This increases the chance
       of DNS UDP packet overflow and the possible necessity for using
       higher overhead TCP in responses."</t>

       <t>Yet defying some expectations, DNS over TCP remained little
       used in real traffic across the Internet.  Dynamic updates saw
       little deployment between autonomous networks.  Around the time
       DNSSEC was first defined, another new feature affecting DNS over
       UDP helped solidify its dominance for message transactions.</t>
     </section>

     <section title="EDNS0">
       <t>In 1999 the IETF published the Extension Mechanisms for DNS
       (EDNS0) in <xref target="RFC2671"></xref>.  This document
       standardized a way for communicating DNS nodes to perform
       rudimentary capabilities negotiation.  One such capability
       written into the base specification and present in every ENDS0
       compatible message is the value of the maximum UDP payload size
       the sender can support.  This unsigned 16-bit field specifies
       in bytes the maximum (possibly fragmented) DNS message size a node is capable of receiving.  In practice, typical values are
       a subset of the 512 to 4096 byte range.  EDNS0 became
       widely deployed over the next several years and numerous surveys
       have shown many systems currently support larger UDP MTUs
       <xref target="CASTRO2010"></xref>, <xref target="NETALYZR"></xref>
       with EDNS0.</t>

       <t>The natural effect of EDNS0 deployment meant DNS
       messages larger than 512 bytes would be less reliant on TCP than they might otherwise
       have been.  While a non-negligible population of DNS systems lack
       EDNS0 or may still fall back to TCP for some transactions, DNS
       over TCP transactions remain a very small fraction of overall
       DNS traffic <xref target="VERISIGN"></xref>.  Nevertheless, some
       average increase in DNS message size, the continued development
       of new DNS features and a denial of service mitigation technique
       (see <xref target="Security"></xref>) have suggested that DNS
       over TCP transactions are as important to the correct and safe
       operation of the Internet DNS as ever, if not more so.  Furthermore,
       there has been serious research that has suggested
       connection-oriented DNS transactions may provide security and
       privacy advantages over UDP transport <xref
       target="TDNS"></xref>.  In fact, <xref target="RFC7858"></xref>,
       a Standards Track document is just this sort of specification.
       Therefore, it might be desirable for network operators to avoid
       artificially inhibiting the potential utility and advances in the
       DNS such as these.</t>
     </section>

     <section title="Fragmentation and Truncation">
       <t>
	Although EDNS0 provides a way for endpoints to signal support
	for DNS messages exceeding 512 bytes, the realities of
	today's Internet mean large messages do not always get
	through.  Any IP packet whose size exceeds the MTU of a
	link it transits will be fragmented and then reassembled
	by the receiving host.  Unfortunately, it is not uncommon
	for middleboxes and firewalls to block IP fragments.  If
	one or more fragments do not arrive, the application does
	not receive the message and the request times out.
      </t>
      <t>
	For IPv4-connected hosts, the de-facto MTU is the Ethernet
	payload size of 1500 bytes.  This means that the largest
	unfragmented UDP DNS message that can be sent over IPv4 is
	1472 bytes.  For IPv6 the situation is a little more
	complicated.  First, IPv6 headers are 40 bytes (versus 20
	in IPv4).  Second, it seems as though some
	people have mis-interpreted IPv6's required minimum MTU of
	1280 as a required maximum.  Third, fragmentation in IPv6
	can only be done by the host originating the packet.  The
	need to fragment is conveyed in an ICMPv6 "packet too big"
	message.  The originating host indicates a fragmented packet
	with IPv6 extension headers.  Unfortunately, it is quite
	common for both ICMPv6 and IPv6 extension headers to be
	blocked by middleboxes.  According to <xref
	target="HUSTON"/> some 35% <!-- 3,592 / 10,115 -->
	of IPv6-capable recursive resolvers are unable to receive
	a fragmented IPv6 packet.
      </t>
      <t>
	The practical consequence of all this is that DNS requestors
	must be prepared to retry queries with different EDNS0 maximum
	message size values.  Administrators of BIND are likely to be 
	familiar with seeing "success resolving ... after reducing the advertised EDNS0 UDP packet size to 512 octets"
	in their system logs.
      </t>
      <t>
	Often, reducing the EDNS0 UDP packet size leads to a successful
	response.  That is, the necessary data fits within the
	smaller packet size.  However, when the data does not fit,
	the server sets the truncated flag in its response, indicating
	the client should retry over TCP to receive the whole
	response.  This is undesirable from the client's point of view
	because it adds more latency, and potentially undesirable from
	the server's point of view due to the increased resource
	requirements of TCP.
	<!-- TODO maybe there is a better way to put that? -->
      </t>
      <t>
	The issues around fragmentation, truncation, and TCP are driving
	certain implementation and policy decisions in the DNS.
	Notably, Cloudflare implemented what it calls "DNSSEC black lies" <xref target="CLOUDFLARE"/> and
	uses ECDSA algorithms, such that their signed responses fit easily in 512 bytes.
	The KSK Rollover design team <xref target="DESIGNTEAM"/> spent a lot of time
	thinking and worrying about response sizes.  There is growing sentiment
	in the DNSSEC community that RSA key sizes beyond 2048-bits are impractical and
	that critical infrastructure zones should transition to elliptic curve algorithms to
	keep response sizes manageable.
      </t>
     </section>

     <section title="&quot;Only Zone Transfers Use TCP&quot;">
       <t>There are many in the DNS community who configure DNS over TCP
       services and expect DNS over TCP transactions to occur without
       interference.  However there has also been a long held belief by
       some operators, particularly for security-related reasons, that
       DNS over TCP services should be purposely limited or not provided
       at all <xref target="CHES94"></xref>, <xref
       target="DJBDNS"></xref>.  A popular meme has also held the
       imagination of some that DNS over TCP is only ever used for zone
       transfers and is generally unnecessary otherwise, with filtering
       all DNS over TCP traffic even described as a best practice.</t>

       <t>The position on restricting DNS over TCP had some
       justification given that historic implementations of DNS
       nameservers provided very little in the way of TCP connection
       management (for example see Section 6.1.2 of <xref
       target="RFC7766"></xref> for more details).  However modern
       standards and implementations are moving to align with the more
       sophisticated TCP management techniques employed by, for example,
       HTTP(S) servers and load balancers.</t>
     </section>
   </section>

   <section title="DNS over TCP Requirements">
     <t>Section 6.1.3.2 in <xref target="RFC1123" /> is updated: All
     general-purpose DNS servers MUST be able to service both UDP and
     TCP queries.
       <list hangIndent="10" style="symbols">
         <t>Authoritative servers MUST service TCP queries so that they
	 do not limit the size of responses to what fits in a single UDP
	 packet.</t>
         <t>Recursive servers (or forwarders) MUST service TCP queries
	 so that they do not prevent large responses from a TCP-capable
	 server from reaching its TCP-capable clients.</t>
       </list>
     Regarding the choice of limiting the resources a server devotes to
     queries, Section 6.1.3.2 in <xref target="RFC1123" /> also says:
       <list hangIndent="10" style="empty">
         <t>A name server MAY limit the resources it devotes to TCP
         queries, but it SHOULD NOT refuse to service a TCP query just
	 because it would have succeeded with UDP.</t>
       </list>
     This requirement is hereby updated: A name server MAY limit the
     the resources it devotes to queries, but it MUST NOT refuse to
     service a query just because it would have succeeded with another
     transport protocol.</t>

     <t>Filtering of DNS over TCP is considered harmful in the general
     case.  DNS resolver and server operators MUST provide DNS service
     over both UDP and TCP transports.  Likewise, network operators MUST
     allow DNS service over both UDP and TCP transports.  It must be
     acknowledged that DNS over TCP service can pose operational
     challenges that are not present when running DNS over UDP alone, and vice-versa.
     However, it is the aim of this document to argue that the potential
     damage incurred by prohibiting DNS over TCP service is more
     detrimental to the continued utility and success of the DNS than
     when its usage is allowed.</t>
   </section>

   <section title="Network and System Considerations">
     <t>TODO: refer to IETF RFC 7766 connection handling discussion,
     various TCP hardening documents, network operator protocol and
     traffic best practices, etc.</t>
   </section>

   <section title="DNS over TCP Filtering Risks">

     <t>Networks that filter DNS over TCP risk losing access to
     significant or important pieces of the DNS name space.  For a
     variety of reasons a DNS answer may require a DNS over TCP query.
     This may include large message sizes, lack of EDNS0 support, DDoS
     mitigation techniques, or perhaps some future capability that is as
     yet unforeseen will also demand TCP transport.</t>

     <t>For example, both <xref target="RFC7901"/> and <xref
     target="draft-extra-answers"/> describe latency-avoiding
     techniques that send extra data in DNS responses.  This makes
     the responses larger and potentially damaging in DDoS reflection
     attacks.  The former mandates the use of TCP or DNS Cookies
     (<xref target="RFC7873"/>) and the latter offers it as a possibility
     in Security Considerations.</t>

     <t>Even if any or all particular answers have consistently been
     returned successfully with UDP in the past, this continued behavior
     cannot be guaranteed when DNS messages are exchanged between
     autonomous systems.  Therefore, filtering of DNS over TCP is
     considered harmful and contrary to the safe and successful operation
     of the Internet.  This section enumerates some of the known risks
     we know about at the time of this writing when networks filter DNS
     over TCP.</t>

     <section title="DNS Wedgie">
       <t>Networks that filter DNS over TCP may inadvertently cause
       problems for third party resolvers as experienced by <xref
       target="TOYAMA"></xref>.  If for instance a resolver receives a
       truncated answer from a server, but when the resolver resends
       the query using TCP and the TCP response never arrives, not only
       will full answer be unavailable, but the resolver will incur the
       full extent of TCP retransmissions and time outs.  This situation
       might place extreme strain on resolver resources.  If the number
       and frequency of these truncated answers are sufficiently high,
       we refer to the steady-state of lost resources as a result a "DNS"
       wedgie".  A DNS wedgie is often not easily or completely mitigated
       by the affected DNS resolver operator.</t>
     </section>

     <section title="DNS Root Zone KSK Rollover">
       <t>Recent plans for a new root zone DNSSEC KSK have highlighted
       a potential problem in retrieving the keys.<xref
       target="LEWIS"></xref>  Some packets in the KSK rollover process
       will be larger than 1280 bytes, the IPv6 minimum MTU for links
       carrying IPv6 traffic.<xref target="RFC2460"></xref>  While
       studies have shown that problems due to fragment filtering or an
       inability to generate and receive these larger messages are
       negligible, any DNS server that is unable to receive large DNS over
       UDP messages or perform DNS over TCP may experience severe
       disruption of DNS service if performing DNSSEC validation.</t>

     about filtering DNS over TCP messages.  Thanks in particular to a
     teaching colleague, JPL, who perhaps unknowingly encouraged the
     initial research into the differences of what the community has
     historically said and did.  Thanks to all the NANOG 63 attendees
     who provided feedback to an early talk on this subject.</t>

     <t>The following individuals provided an array of feedback to help
     improve this document: Sara Dickinson, Bob Harold, Tatuya Jinmei,
     and Paul Hoffman.  The authors are indebted to their contributions.

     <t>Ironically, returning truncated DNS over UDP answers in order
     to induce a client query to switch to DNS over TCP has become
     a common response to source address spoofed, DNS denial-of-service
     attacks <xref target="RRL"></xref>.  Historically, operators have
     been wary of TCP-based attacks, but in recent years, UDP-based
     flooding attacks have proven to be the most common protocol attack
     on the DNS.  Nevertheless, a high rate of short-lived DNS
     transactions over TCP may pose challenges.  While many operators
     have provided DNS over TCP service for many years without duress,
     past experience is no guarantee of future success.</t>

     <t>DNS over TCP is not unlike many other Internet TCP services.
     TCP threats and many mitigation strategies have been well

   <section title="Standards Related to DNS Transport over TCP">
     <t>This section enumerates all known IETF RFC documents that are
     currently of status standard, informational, best common practice
     or experimental and either implicitly or explicitly make
     assumptions or statements about the use of TCP as a transport for
     the DNS germane to this document.</t>

     <section title="TODO - additional, relevant RFCs">
     </section>

     <section title="IETF RFC 7477 - Child-to-Parent Synchronization in DNS">
       <t>This standards track document <xref target="RFC7477"></xref>
       specifies a RRType and protocol to signal and synchronize NS, A,
       and AAAA resource record changes from a child to parent zone.
       Since this protocol may require multiple requests and responses,
       it recommends utilizing DNS over TCP to ensure the conversation
       takes place between a consistent pair of end nodes.</t>
     </section>

     <section title="IETF RFC 7766 - DNS Transport over TCP - Implementation Requirements">
       <t>The standards track document <xref target="RFC7766"></xref>
       might be considered the direct ancestor of this operational
       requirements document.  The implementation requirements document
       codifies mandatory support for DNS over TCP in compliant DNS
       software.</t>
     </section>

     <section title="IETF RFC 7828 - The edns-tcp-keepalive EDNS0 Option">
       <t>This standards track document <xref target="RFC7828"></xref>
       defines an EDNS0 option to negotiate an idle timeout value for
       long-lived DNS over TCP connections.  Consequently, this document
       is only applicable and relevant to DNS over TCP sessions and
       between implementations that support this option.</t>
     </section>

     <section title="IETF RFC 7873 - Domain Name System (DNS) Cookies">
       <t>This standards track document <xref target="RFC7873"></xref>
       describes an EDNS0 option to provide additional protection
       against query and answer forgery.  This specification mentions
       DNS over TCP as a reasonable fallback mechanism when DNS Cookies
       are not available.  The specification does make mention of DNS
       over TCP processing in two specific situations.  In one, when a
       server receives only a client cookie in a request, the server
       should consider whether the request arrived over TCP and if so,
       it should consider accepting TCP as sufficient to authenticate
       the request and respond accordingly.  In another, when a client
       receives a BADCOOKIE reply using a fresh server cookie, the
       client should retry using TCP as the transport.</t>
     </section>

     <section title="IETF RFC 7901 - CHAIN Query Requests in DNS">
       <t>This experimental specification <xref target="RFC7901"></xref>
       describes an EDNS0 option that can be used by a security-aware
       validating resolver to request and obtain a complete DNSSEC
       validation path for any single query.  This document requires the
       use of DNS over TCP or a source IP address verified transport
       mechanism such as EDNS-COOKIE.<xref target="RFC7873"></xref></t>
     </section>

     <section title="IETF RFC 8027 - DNSSEC Roadblock Avoidance">
       <t>This document <xref target="RFC8027"></xref> details observed
       problems with DNSSEC deployment and mitigation techniques.
       Network traffic blocking and restrictions, including DNS over TCP
       messages, are highlighted as one reason for DNSSEC deployment
       issues.  While this document suggests these sorts of problems are
       due to "non-compliant infrastructure" and is of type BCP, the
       scope of the document is limited to detection and mitigation
       techniques to avoid so-called DNSSEC roadblocks.</t>
